# Horiseon Landing Page Refactor

## Description

Welcome to the readme file for the code refactoring assignment. The primary objective of this task was to optimize the website's code to improve accessibility for our clients. As we know, creating an accessible website can benefit businesses in various ways, such as enhancing their visibility on search engines like Google and avoiding potential legal issues due to inaccessibility for people with disabilities.

To impress clients, it is essential to go the extra mile and improve the website's codebase for long-term sustainability. One way to achieve this is to ensure that all links are working correctly. Additionally, reworking the CSS to make it more efficient can improve the website's performance. This can be done by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to align with the semantic structure of the HTML elements, and adding comments before each element or section of the page.

As part of this assignment, I have successfully improved the site's link function, consolidated and organized CSS selectors and properties, created useful comments for the code, and overall improved the site's SEO. I have learned a lot about the importance and steps necessary to properly refactor a site with accesability in mind.
